\title{Extract age stratified case count of disease positive cases.}
\usage{
get_timeseries(
  disease = diseases$`COVID-19`,
  measure = c("Count", "Incidence"),
  age_group = age_groups$single_year,
  quiet = FALSE,
  trim_zeros = c("leading", "both", "none")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{disease}{the disease of interest, see \code{rsurvstat::diseases}}

\item{measure}{one of "Count" or "Incidence"}

\item{age_group}{the age_group of interest, see \code{rsurvstat::age_groups}}

\item{quiet}{suppress loading messages}

\item{trim_zeros}{get rid of zero counts. Either "both" (from start and end),
"leading" (from start only - the default) or "none".}
}
\value{
a data frame with age_cat (ordered factor), age_start, age_end, elapsed_week (weeks since 2020-12-31), date
(start of week date approximate) and one of count, incidence or population
columns
}
\description{
N.b. its not possible to differentiate between missing data and zero counts
in the source dataset.
}
\examples{
get_timeseries(diseases$`COVID-19`, measure = "Count", age_group = age_groups$zero_fifteen_sixty)
}
